I can assure you there are bugs in this, so, I'll leave it up to you to figure 
them out, as I don't exactly like people copying and pasting from tutorials and 
then trying to pass it off as their own work... That really shits me. This will 
work with all code releases previous to the 3.12/3.13 point release to which the 
source code is yet to be released. You may NOT, under any circumstances, program 
a patch for the point release code with the code supplied here, and claim it as 
your programming if the codebase for the point release is any different. 
Please respect my intelligence, and my coding skills. 
You can however stick this into your mod, or use it as a basis for a mod, but if 
it's going to be commercial I'd like to hear about it, (mainly for interest's 
sake) and feel free to modify it. 
You can distribute this as much as you want, as long as this section of the 
tutorial stays in it, and the rest of it isn't butchered. I would like people to 
distribute it, as it was a problem that frustrated me for a while until I 
figured it out. Other people out there are surely wanting to know how to do it 
as well. 
But if you use this as a base, then you must give me some sort of credit or some 
mention, especially as it seems to be the only chasecam patch around so far. I 
probably sound arrogant by saying that but I think it's true. 
My email for now is frolicka@hotmail.com because I'm getting a new ISP within a 
day or two and it's going to get cut off when I switch servers. Any comments or 
suggestions would be appreciated and you can also reach me with ICQ. My no. is 
6580358. 
But have fun, and enjoy coding. It rocks, for sure!

After running through the original Chase Camera tutorial I noticed several 
aspects of the camera that could easily be improved upon to generate a much more 
pleasing experience to those using the camera. Feel free to use my 
additions/subtractions to James' source in your own mods, but please give both 
myself and James credit where it is do. 
Introduction 
Quake I had some lovely functions... Namely, WriteEntity(), which was used for 
WriteByte (SVC_SETVIEWPORT) which in turn was a command that the coder could use 
for placing an external camera outside the player entity, by creating an entity 
which was used as a target for the display. 
Quake II has had this function removed (as such), and written in as code 
contained in the C files. 
The Quake II interface works thusly : 
The client, (The human player controlling) is different from the player and so 
therefore the characteristics which are literally existent in the entity. This 
is a strange concept, I know. 
There are attributes within the client tag, like 'pmove'. The pmove tag and 
others similar in the same area, control the literal effects and think outines 
to manipulate the main entity. 
For instance, the "sv_gravity" cvar, effects the client gravity values in the 
pmove, which modifies certain effects to the players velocities, origins, and 
angles. These such client tags are applied to all player entities, and vary from 
view angles, to the offsets and origin of the view camera. 


The Main Coding 
First open up the file G_LOCAL.H and go to the gclient_s structure. If you don't 
know what that is, then go to around line 835. The lines beginning with + are 
the lines i have added: 
        int                     weapon_sound;



        float           pickup_msg_time;



        float           respawn_time;           // can respawn when time > this



+        //SBOF: chasecam variables

+        int             chasetoggle;

+        edict_t         *chasecam;

+        edict_t         *oldplayer;



} gclient_t;
EXPLANATION: 
These new variables we just added are now accessible via 
(entity name)->client->chasetoggle, 
(entity name)->client->chasecam, and 
(entity name)->client->oldplayer. 
The chasetoggle is a number which we can use to determine whether the camera is 
on or not, while the others are entities that are easier to access via 
personally linked variables. The oldplayer entity is an entity which is used for 
display purposes to the person who is using the chasecam. This we will come to 
later. 


NEXT STEP: 
Still in the G_LOCAL.H file, go to the edict_s structure. Again, if you do not 
know what I'm talking about, go to around line 870. Go to the bottom of the 
structure and add: 
        gitem_t         *item;                  // for bonus items



        // common data blocks

        moveinfo_t              moveinfo;

        monsterinfo_t   monsterinfo;



+        //SBOF: Chasecam variables

+        int                     chasedist1;

+        int                     chasedist2;



};

EXPLANATION: 
These two integer values are for the chasecam to determine distances between the 
camera entity and the player. I shouldn't really say this, but they're not as 
important, really, as the chasecam and oldplayer entities, nor the toggle, 
because they are only called by one function, and are used by an entity which is 
not a client, which therefore disables the ability to edit the chascam's 
->client variables as the camera is NOT a client. (Human player) 
These variables are accessed as (entity)->chasedist? and can be used for other 
integer functions in the same (entity)->chasedist? fields. 

NEXT STEP: 
Go to the very bottom of G_LOCAL.H and add : 

extern void CheckChasecam_Viewent(edict_t *ent);

EXPLANATION: 
This becomes a global function which tells the compiler that it SHOULD be define 
later in the code and not to worry if it comes across it being mentioned before 
the routine is defined. 


NEXT STEP: 
Create a file called S_CAM.C and add these lines to the file: 
        #include "g_local.h"



        void ChasecamTrack (edict_t *ent);
EXPLANATION: 
Adding the #include will load up the Quake II code base which contains valuable 
information that other C files need to know so the C file can "talk" to Quake 
II. 
The ChasecamTrack function with no subsequent code, is for other functions that 
require this function before the function is defined, therefore letting the 
compiler know that the function is still yet to come and that the coder hasn't 
forgotten to put this function in. This line should technically be placed in a 
header file (ie, s_cam.h) and be included at the top of this file, but as it's 
the only line needed as a header, we don't justify creating a second file for it 
=) 


NEXT STEP: 
Add the creation functions for the chasecam : (to the same file) 


        /*  The ent is the owner of the chasecam  */

          void ChasecamStart (edict_t *ent)

          {



        /* This creates a tempory entity we can manipulate within this

         * function */

             edict_t      *chasecam;

        

        /* Tell everything that looks at the toggle that our chasecam is on

         * and working */

             ent->client->chasetoggle = 1;



        /* Make out gun model "non-existent" so it's more realistic to the

         * player using the chasecam */

             ent->client->ps.gunindex = 0;

        

           chasecam = G_Spawn ();

           chasecam->owner = ent;

           chasecam->solid = SOLID_NOT;

           chasecam->movetype = MOVETYPE_FLYMISSILE;
           // Added by WarZone - Begin
           ent->client->ps.pmove.pm_flags |= PMF_NO_PREDICTION; // this turns off Quake2's inclination to predict where the camera is going,
                                                                                                  // making a much smoother ride
           ent->svflags |= SVF_NOCLIENT; // this line tells Quake2 not to send the unnecessary info about the camera to other players
           // Added by WarZone - End





EXPLANATION: 
The last four lines here will create an entity called "chasecam", make the owner 
of the entity, "ent" (me), make the camera not solid, and let it move around 
freely. 


NEXT STEP: 
Put this text into the same function at the end: 
        /* Now, make the angles of the player model, (!NOT THE HUMAN VIEW!) be

         * copied to the same angle of the chasecam entity */

           VectorCopy (ent->s.angles, chasecam->s.angles);

        

        /* Clear the size of the entity, so it DOES technically have a size,

         * but that of '0 0 0'-'0 0 0'. (xyz, xyz). mins = Minimum size,

         * maxs = Maximum size */

           VectorClear (chasecam->mins);

           VectorClear (chasecam->maxs);

        

        /* Make the chasecam's origin (position) be the same as the player

         * entity's because as the camera starts, it will force itself out

         * slowly backwards from the player model */

           VectorCopy (ent->s.origin, chasecam->s.origin);

        

           chasecam->classname = "chasecam";
           chasecam->prethink = ChasecamTrack;



EXPLANATION: 
Make the chasecam entity's name be "chasecam" for paranoia reasons in case we 
have a bug of unknown origin, and wish to trace the bug via classnames. 
The prethink function is ChasecamTrack, which is called very frequently to keep 
track of the position of the chasecam behind the player model. In fact the 
prethink function is called once before every server frame is drawn, making for 
very smooth camera operations. 


NEXT STEP: 
Finish the function by adding two VERY important lines: 
           ent->client->chasecam = chasecam;     

           ent->client->oldplayer = G_Spawn();

        }


EXPLANATION: 
This will copy the client's personal chasecam entity the object we just made, 
and create the "oldplayer" entity, which is just an object for display purposes. 
The "oldplayer" is updated in another function which we WILL get to, later in 
this tutorial. (I bet you're just ACHING to find out :>) 
NEXT STEP: 
Add in this function which becomes the think routine when the player is in 
water. In this case, the "ent" is the chasecam entity. 


        void ChasecamRestart (edict_t *ent)

        {



        /* Keep thinking this function to check all the time whether the

         * player is out of the water */

        /* If the player is dead, the camera is not wanted... Kill me and stop

         * the function. (return;) */

           if (ent->owner->health <= 0)

           {

              G_FreeEdict (ent);

              return;

           }



        /* If the player is still underwater, break the routine */

           if (ent->owner->waterlevel)

              return;

        

        /* If the player is NOT under water, and not dead, then he's going to

         * want his camera back. Create a new camera, then remove the old one

         * that's not doing anything. We could quite easily 're-instate' the

         * old camera, but I'm lazy :) */

           ChasecamStart (ent->owner);

           G_FreeEdict (ent);

        

        }


EXPLANATION: 
Read the comments you ignoramus! :] 
NEXT STEP: 
Add in the function for removing the chasecam when asked to vanish, and to call 
the thinking function when underwater. 


     /* Here, the "ent" is referring to the client, the player that owns the

      * chasecam, and the "opt" string is telling the function whether to

      * totally get rid of the camera, or to put it into the background while

      * it checks if the player is out of the water or not. The "opt" could

      * have easily been a string, and might have used less memory, but it is

      * easier to have a string as it is clearer to the reader */

        void ChasecamRemove (edict_t *ent, char *opt)

        {

        

        /* Stop the chasecam from moving */

           VectorClear (ent->client->chasecam->velocity);

        

        /* Make the weapon model of the player appear on screen for 1st

         * person reality and aiming */

           ent->client->ps.gunindex = gi.modelindex(ent->client->pers.weapon->view_model);



        /* Make our invisible appearance the same model as the display entity

         * that mimics us while in chasecam mode */

           ent->s.modelindex = ent->client->oldplayer->s.modelindex;


           // Added by WarZone - Begin
          ent->svflags &= ~SVF_NOCLIENT;

          if (!strcmp(opt, "background"))
          {
              ent->client->chasetoggle = 0;
              G_FreeEdict (ent->client->chasecam);
              G_FreeEdict (ent->client->oldplayer);
              ent->client->chasecam = G_Spawn ();
              ent->client->chasecam->owner = ent;
              ent->client->chasecam->solid = SOLID_NOT;
              ent->client->chasecam->movetype = MOVETYPE_FLYMISSILE;
              VectorClear (ent->client->chasecam->mins);
              VectorClear (ent->client->chasecam->maxs);
              ent->client->chasecam->classname = "chasecam";
              ent->client->chasecam->prethink = ChasecamRestart; // begin checking for emergence from the water
     }
          // Added by WarZone - End
EXPLANATION: 
If the string sent to this function is telling us to go inactive, but on because 
that will tell all other functions looking at the toggle variable, that the 
chasecam is not active, but is still there. Change the prethink routine to the 
ChasecamRestart function which checks if we are out of the water. 


NEXT STEP: 
Continue with this function. 
           else if (!strcmp(opt, "off"))

           {

               // Added by WarZone - Begin
               if (ent->client->chasetoggle)
               {
                     free(ent->client->oldplayer->client); // needed??
                     G_FreeEdict (ent->client->oldplayer);
               }
               ent->client->chasetoggle = 0;
               G_FreeEdict (ent->client->chasecam);
               // Added by WarZone - End

           }

        }


EXPLANATION: 
If the string sent to this function is NOT "background" but "off", then it is 
telling us to TOTALLY remove the chasecamera, toggle it off, and remove the 
display entity, which we won't need anymore. Do so. 
NEXT STEP: 
Gape at the amount of coding for some complicated camera manipulation, at which 
even I am at a loss to dictate all of. Therefore, all my comments here will be.. 
*ahem*.. brief :)

            * a length to determine whether we should accelerate faster from

            * the player or not */

              VectorSubtract (ent->owner->s.origin, ent->s.origin, spot1);

        

              if (VectorLength(spot1) < 20)

              {

                 ent->velocity[0] *= 2; 

                 ent->velocity[1] *= 2; 

                 ent->velocity[2] *= 2; 

        

              }

        

           }



        /* if we DID hit something in the tr.fraction call ages back, then

         * make the spot2 we created, the position for the chasecamera. */

           else

              VectorCopy (spot2, ent->s.origin);



        /* add to the distance between the player and the camera */

           ent->chasedist1 += 2;



        /* if we're too far away, give us a maximum distance */

           if (ent->chasedist1 > 60.00)

              ent->chasedist1 = 60.000;



        /* if we haven't gone anywhere since the last think routine, and we

         * are greater than 20 points in the distance calculated, add one to

         * the second chasedistance variable



         * The "ent->movedir" is a vector which is not used in this entity, so

         * we can use this a tempory vector belonging to the chasecam, which

         * can be carried through think routines. */

           if (ent->movedir == ent->s.origin)

           {

              if (distance > 20)

                 ent->chasedist2++;

           }



        /* if we've buggered up more than 3 times, there must be some mistake,

         * so restart the camera so we re-create a chasecam, destroy the old one,

         * slowly go outwards from the player, and keep thinking this routing in

         * the new camera entity */

           if (ent->chasedist2 > 3)

           {

              ChasecamStart (ent->owner);

              G_FreeEdict(ent);

              return;

           }





       /* Copy the position of the chasecam now, and stick it to the movedir

         * variable, for position checking when we rethink this function */

           VectorCopy (ent->s.origin, ent->movedir);

        

        }
EXPLANATION: 
Phew!... Don't ask me.. I just wrote it all :) 
NEXT STEP: 
Add in a relief step for all those people concentrating hard, a very simple 
function for toggling the camera on and off. 


        void Cmd_Chasecam_Toggle (edict_t *ent)
        {
            // Added by WarZone - Begin
            if (!ent->waterlevel && !ent->deadflag)
            {
                  if (ent->client->chasetoggle)
                       ChasecamRemove (ent, "off");
                  else
                       ChasecamStart (ent);
            }
            else if (ent->waterlevel && !ent->deadflag)
                 gi.cprintf (ent, PRINT_HIGH, "Camera cannot be modified while in water\n");
            // Added by WarZone - End
        }


EXPLANATION: 
The "ent" here is the player, as this function is called through "cmd chasecam" 
as typed in from the console. We are yet to get to that, but, if the chasecam is 
on, inactive or not, we will remove it, by calling the ChasecamRemove function 
and telling it to turn OFF completely, which cleans up all the garbage 
variables. 
If the chasecam is off and we DONT have anything in the chasetoggle field, 
create us a camera entity with the ent being sent to the function being the 
player. 
NEXT STEP: 


Add in the support for the oldplayer display entity, which is still in the same 
file (s_cam.c), which is called from P_VIEW.C. 


        void CheckChasecam_Viewent (edict_t *ent)

        {
                // Added by WarZone - Begin
                gclient_t       *cl;
    
                if (!ent->client->oldplayer->client)
                {
                    cl = (gclient_t *) malloc(sizeof(gclient_t));
                    ent->client->oldplayer->client = cl;
                }
                // Added by WarZone - End

                if ((ent->client->chasetoggle == 1) && (ent->client->oldplayer))

                {

                        ent->client->oldplayer->s.frame = ent->s.frame;

EXPLANATION: 
The "ent" is the player. 
If the chasecam is on, _AND_ active, and there is a display entity we can 
update, then update the frame of the display entity, with the entity of 
ourselves. Even though we are not using the player model, there are still 
references to the frame we should be displaying to everyone, and we are copying 
that frame to the vaild modelindex of the display entity, "oldplayer". The 
addition above adds in a client structure to the "oldplayer", thus allowing us 
to disable the client prediction on the camera, and have the "oldplayer" be used 
for the prediction instead. This give the "oldplayer" version of your character 
better performance in multiplayer games as well. 
NEXT STEP: 
Add a bit more to this routine of updating the oldplayer entity 


                     /* Copy the origin, the speed, and the model angle, NOT

                      * literal angle to the display entity */

                        VectorCopy (ent->s.origin, ent->client->oldplayer->s.origin);

                        VectorCopy (ent->velocity, ent->client->oldplayer->velocity);

                        VectorCopy (ent->s.angles, ent->client->oldplayer->s.angles);



                     /* Make sure we are using the same model + skin as selected,

                      * as well as the weapon model the player model is holding.

                      * For customized deathmatch weapon displaying, you can

                      * use the modelindex2 for different weapon changing, as you

                      * can read in forthcoming tutorials */

                         // Added by WarZone - Begin
                        ent->client->oldplayer->s = ent->s; // copies over all of the important player related information
                        // Added by WarZone - End
       
                        gi.linkentity (ent->client->oldplayer);

                }

        

        }



EXPLANATION: 
Read the comments, but the last line where it "links" the entity, makes sure 
that the game updates the state of the oldplayer entity model. The last line 
here is fairly important. 
Well, that's it for "S_CAM.C". Close "S_CAM.C" and open up G_CMDS.C for the 
implentation of toggling the chasecam. 


NEXT STEP: 
Scroll down to the ClientCommand() routine which handles all the... umm... 
commands and add in these lines: 
        else if (Q_stricmp (cmd, "wave") == 0)

                Cmd_Wave_f (ent);



+    //SBOF: well, gee.... I'm not sure.

+        else if (Q_stricmp (cmd, "chasecam") == 0)

+                Cmd_Chasecam_Toggle (ent);


EXPLANATION: 
Now, this will activate the ability to type "CMD chasecam" at the console, or 
have this bound to a key to toggle the chasecam on and off. 
NEXT STEP: 
Close G_CMDS.C and open P_WEAPON.C. In this file you will add in the code so 
that when you change weapons when using the chasecam, the weapon will not appear 
in front of you. Scroll down to the ChangeWeapon() routine (about line 175) and 
go to the bottom of the function. Add in: 


                ent->client->ps.gunindex = 0;

                return;

        }



        ent->client->weaponstate = WEAPON_ACTIVATING;

        ent->client->ps.gunframe = 0;

+        if (!ent->client->chasetoggle)

                ent->client->ps.gunindex = gi.modelindex(ent->client->pers.weapon->view_model);



}


EXPLANATION: 
This will check whether the chasecam is on, and it not, it will update the 
weapon model you see on the screen with the model associated with your current 
weapon. 
NEXT STEP: 
NB: This step is _*the*_ most important step of all. This is the step that has 
replaced the original Quake I WriteEntity() function that many people have been 
musing over. I have finally figured it out after months of "musing", and found 
that the LITERAL origin of the client display which is sent to the screen, each 
co-ordinate, MUST be multiplied by 8 to become a valid origin point in regards 
to the viewport.
Change: 
        VectorAdd (v, ent->client->kick_origin, v);



        // absolutely bound offsets

        // so the view can never be outside the player box



        if (v[0] < -14)

                v[0] = -14;

        else if (v[0] > 14)

                v[0] = 14;

        if (v[1] < -14)

                v[1] = -14;

        else if (v[1] > 14)

                v[1] = 14;

        if (v[2] < -22)

                v[2] = -22;

        else if (v[2] > 30)

                v[2] = 30;



        VectorCopy (v, ent->client->ps.viewoffset);

}
To: 
        VectorAdd (v, ent->client->kick_origin, v);



        // absolutely bound offsets

        // so the view can never be outside the player box



        if (!ent->client->chasetoggle)

        {

                if (v[0] < -14)

                        v[0] = -14;

                else if (v[0] > 14)

                        v[0] = 14;

                if (v[1] < -14)

                        v[1] = -14;

                else if (v[1] > 14)

                        v[1] = 14;

                if (v[2] < -22)

                        v[2] = -22;

                else if (v[2] > 30)

                        v[2] = 30;

        }

        else

        { 

                VectorSet (v, 0, 0, 0);

                if (ent->client->chasecam != NULL)

                {

                        ent->client->ps.pmove.origin[0] = ent->client->chasecam->s.origin[0]*8;

                        ent->client->ps.pmove.origin[1] = ent->client->chasecam->s.origin[1]*8;

                        ent->client->ps.pmove.origin[2] = ent->client->chasecam->s.origin[2]*8;

                        VectorCopy (ent->client->chasecam->s.angles, ent->client->ps.viewangles);

                }

        }

        VectorCopy (v, ent->client->ps.viewoffset);

}


EXPLANATION: 
This will copy the origin of the chasecam to the literal pmove.origin which is 
the origin of the display to the human using the computer, and multiply the 
chasecamera co-ordinates by 8, thus creating a valid origin point for the view 
camera. 
NEXT STEP: 
Go to the very bottom of the file, and in the very bottom of the function called 
ClientEndServerFrame(), add this before the final "}": 

        if (ent->client->chasetoggle == 1)

                CheckChasecam_Viewent(ent);

EXPLANATION: 
If the chasecam is ON, *AND* active, then we need to update the "oldplayer" 
display entity. 
NEXT STEP: 
Hehehe... not done yet folks. Let's open up the good ol' p_client.c file to 
see if we can make this mod a bit more multiplayer friendly... 


Goto the respawn function modify it as described below: 
         void respawn (edict_t *self) 
        { 
        // Added by WarZone - Begin 
                if (self->client->oldplayer) 
                        G_FreeEdict (self->client->oldplayer); 
                if (self->client->chasecam) 
                        G_FreeEdict (self->client->chasecam); 
        // Added by WarZone - End 
        ... rest of respawn function follows (no changes) ... 
  
Now, goto PutClientInServer and add the indicated line: 
  
  void PutClientInServer (edict_t *ent) 
  { 
       ... 
       // clear entity values 
       ent->groundentity = NULL; 
       ent->client = &game.clients[index]; 
       ent->takedamage = DAMAGE_AIM; 
       ent->movetype = MOVETYPE_WALK; 
       ent->viewheight = 22; 
       ent->inuse = true; 
       ent->classname = "player"; 
       ent->mass = 200; 
       ent->solid = SOLID_BBOX; 
       ent->deadflag = DEAD_NO; 
       ent->air_finished = level.time + 12; 
       ent->clipmask = MASK_PLAYERSOLID; 
       ent->model = "players/male/tris.md2"; 
       ent->pain = player_pain; 
       ent->die = player_die; 
       ent->waterlevel = 0; 
       ent->watertype = 0; 
       ent->flags &= ~FL_NO_KNOCKBACK; 
       ent->svflags &= ~SVF_DEADMONSTER; 
  +   ent->svflags &= ~SVF_NOCLIENT; 
       ... 
  }
Save and exit. You're done. (I hope I haven't left anything out) 
Some ideas to work on on your own (hehehe, two on's in a row) might be: 
  Allowing the player to view other players with the chase camera (ala RA2) - 
  Medium 
  Make the camera free floating, rather than bound to the player's perspective - 
  Hard (I think, maybe not) 
  Try making the camera work even when in water - I am positive that this can be 
  done, I'm just lazy... - Hard (again, it might not be that hard in reality) 
  Add in a feature to allow the game DLL to force someone's camera to turn on in 
  certain situations (cool effect) - Easy 
  Add in a "zoomin" and "zoomout" feature to the chase camera to allow players 
  to have control over how close behind the camera follows (just don't let them 
  zoom too far out, or it'll look really crappy, try it and see what I mean. For 
  that matter, don't let them get too close either!) - Easy 
Have fun with this, and email me (WarZone) if you plan to use this tutorial in 
your mod. I would like to keep track of which mods are using this, and I 
encourage you to do so. Having a chase camera in your mod really adds an extra 
dimention to the mod. Happy coding!
