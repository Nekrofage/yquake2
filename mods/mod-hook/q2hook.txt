Swinging Grappling Hook Mod v1.4 for Quake2         12/09/98
Compiled with v3.20 Quake2 source code
-------------------------------------------------------------


What's new
----------
Just recompiled it with the sorely needed v3.20 Quake2 source
code just released.


Features
--------
- unprecedented use of true to life swinging physics
- ability to climb up or drop down the chain
- ability to push opponent(i.e. in lava) or inflict damage
  from hook impact
- undisturbed use of weapons during hook use


Description
-----------
Grappling hook is a rotating iron shaft with claws, thrown by
a chain and used for grasping, drawing and holding. Can be
used for getting out of tight spots, getting to unreachable
places, and even stabbing your enemy, inflicting great pain.
Make your self a hard target to hit by swinging from the hook
while taking shots at the poor saps bellow. The grappling hook
does not use any ammunition.


Installation
------------
Unzip all the contents of this archive(preserving the directory
structure) into the Quake2 directory. To start the game, run
the Q2hook.bat from the Quake2 directory. Extra parameters can
be added to the Q2hook.bat just like so: 
Q2hook.bat +map mapname


Usage
-----
The default keys for using the hook are:

    SHIFT = for launching or releasing the hook (if held down
            while launching, player gets pulled until release)  
        R = for pulling or climbing the chain
        W = for sliding down or giving slack to the chain

	As you are hanging use the movement keys to amplify
	your swing into the desired direction.	

Note that these are just the keys that happen to fit well 
with my key configuration. You could change any of the default
keys to ones of your choice by editing the hook.cfg found in
the ..\quake2\hook directory with a text editor. To map
different keys, replace SHIFT, R, and W with keys of your
choice and save.


Server console variables
------------------------
Edit some of the hook attributes to your liking through the
following server console variables either by typing them directly
into the console while in the game or inserting them in the
hook.cfg to be loaded at the start: 
  
hook_speed 
	Useful values:500-2200; Default:1000     
	Speed the hook is launched

hook_min_len 
	Useful values:0-100; Default:40
	Minimum length chain can be reeled in

hook_max_len
	Useful values:500-1850; Default:1000
	Maximum length chain can be reeled out

hook_rpf
	Useful values:20-110; Default:40
	Rate(reel in/reel out) per frame

hook_no_pred
	Valid values:0/non-0; Default:0
	A non-0 value disables prediction while suspended in air by hook
	Reduces swinging jerkiness on slow connections


Incorporating this patch with another
-------------------------------------
The source code for this mod in found in the /hook/src/ directory.
Open the p_hook.c file with a text editor and look at the top
commented section. There you will find an outline of the exact
changes that were done to the original Quake2 source files. To add
this patch to another simply apply those changes to the source code
of the other patch, add the p_hook.c to the project, and recompile.


The most frequently asked question
----------------------------------
Q: The grappling hook works fine in single player mode but why
   doesn't it work when I play on the Internet?

A: Quake2 not unlike Quake is one of the first games to run
   on a true client server model. The server runs the gamex86.dll
   (the compiled game logic C code) not the client. This means that
   only the server can be patched with a game logic modification.
   In a single player situation, you local machine runs both the
   server and the client, so the patch is being used by your local
   server. When playing Quake or Quake2 on the Internet you are
   playing on somebody else's server. In this situation your
   computer is only running the client and you have no control over
   what game logic you play with. All the client does is loads
   resources(skins, models, sounds, maps, etc.) ordered by the
   server's game logic, renders/plays those resources also controlled
   by the server's game logic, and sends back input data to the 
   server to update its virtual world data. So, the only way to play
   my hook patch(or any other patch for that mater) over the
   Internet, is to connect to a server that has it installed or urge
   the operator of that server to run that mod. This design
   prevents players from having unfair advantages on net games and
   empowers the server operator with total control over rules and
   behavior of the game.
